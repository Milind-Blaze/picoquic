# Performance measurement for Picoquic and TCP code

First, set up picoquic as per the original instructions provided by Cloudflare.

## TC rules 

- Checking TC rule

```
tc -s qdisc show dev lo
```

- Removing TC rule

```
sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root 2>/dev/null
```

- Adding a 100 Mbps TC rule

```
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 100Mbit burst 2mbit latency 40ms
```

    - Checking HZ on system
    ```
    egrep '^CONFIG_HZ_[0-9]+' /boot/config-`uname -r`
    ```

## Picoquic

### Create files to be transferred

- Below experiments are done using large file transfer. The files can be created using 

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=transfer_test_1G.htm bs=1G count=1
```

(or a .txt file according to preference).

**Create a directory named ```server_files``` in the ```picoquic``` root directory
and create this file there,** i.e, it should have the path 

```
picoquic/server_files/transfer_test_1G.htm
```

- Similarly, create a ```client_files/``` directory in the ```picoquic``` root directory.

### Throughput measurements

- These are based on the ```picoquicdemo``` code.  

- Create a ```throughput_dl``` directory in ```picoquic/performance_measurement```.
This is where your resulting csv files will go.

#### Experiment

- Start the server from the ```picoquic``` directory using 
```
./picoquicdemo -w server_files/ -p 4433
```
- Run the ```throughput_dl_cli.sh``` script from  ```picoquic/performance_measurement_scripts``` as 

```
./throughput_dl_cli.sh 25 transfer_test_1G.htm ../throughput_dl/transfer_test_1G_results.csv
```

This will run the client 25 times, each time transferring transfer_test_1G.htm from ```server_files```
to ```client files``` and then store the average throughput in ```../throughput_dl/transfer_test_1G_results.csv```.

- Then from ```picoquic/performance_measurements/scripts```, run 

```
python3 plot_throughput_dl.py
```
The ```files```, ```output_file_name_png``` and ```output_file_name_pdf``` variables 
have to be changed appropriately to produce the plot. This will create a bar graph 
with the throughput.

- Repeat for different file sizes as you please.

- Set the TC rule and repeat the experiement. Change the file names and file paths accordingly.

- Stop the server after the experiement is done.

### CPU usage measurement

- This is also based on the picoquicdemo code
- Make sure that no picoquic server or client is running and that the file structure is as 
described previously.
- Create a nested directory named ```cpu_usage/1GB``` in ```picoquic/performance_measurement```
- From the ```scripts``` directory, run

```
./cpu_usage.sh 25 transfer_test_1G.htm performance_measurement/cpu_usage/1GB/
```

This will do the following 25 times
    - start the server and start measuring cpu usage
    - start the client and start measuring cpu usage
    - record those in ```server_usage_<iter_num>.csv``` and ```client_usage_<iter_num>.csv``` files
    in ```performance_measurement/cpu_usage/1GB/``` at intervals of 1s 
        - **Note**: this 1s is hard coded both into the top command how the time measurement is 
        recorded using a counter
    - close client and monitor process
    - wait and then close server and monitor process (not necessarily in that order)

- From ```picoquic/scripts``` run

```
python3 plot_cpu_usage.py
```

The ```folders``` and ```n_iterations_used``` variables need to be set correctly. ```n_iterations_used```
restricts how many iterations of the experiment are used for plotting. The ```yrange``` variable needs
to be set depending on what the range of CPU usage variation is going to be.

- Repeat experiment for other file sizes or with TC rules set.

### Latency measurement 

- Switch to the ```latency_measurement``` branch.
- These measurements are done using the sample code instead of picoquicdemo
- The experimental setup invovles some hardcoding and global variables that need
to be set beforehand
- Determine the message size: this will be the size of the file that is being 
transferred. Create these files in the ```picoquic/server_files``` directory. Then create a 
symlink to it in ```picoquic/sample/``` so that ```server_files``` is available as a
directory in ```picoquic_sample``` (alternately, you can just create those files/that folder
in the ```sample``` directory directly)
- Open the ```picoquic/sample/``` directory. 
- Create a ```temp/``` directory.
- Follow the instructions in the ```sample``` directory to create the necessary keys and certificates.
This should involve the following steps
    - ```openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem```
    - Set the passphrase to ```1234``` and hit ```Enter``` for the other fields. This creates ```server-key.pem``` and ```server-req.pem```.

#### Experiment

- Now set the global variables in ```sample_client.c```
```
int transfer_filesize = 10240;
int timestamp_filesize = 10240;
```
These should be set to the size of the file you are transferring (obtain using ```ls -al```). Sizes
can be varied from 1 B, 10 B, 10 KB, ..., 1 MB, etc. **Note that both the variables should be set
to the same value**.

- Then set the global variables in ```sample_server.c```
```
int n_iterations = 25;
int n_next = 25;
```

Set ```n_iterations``` to how many times the message should be sent to client in each connection.
Set ```n_next``` to the same value.

- From ```picoquic``` run

```
make picoquic_sample
```

- From ```picoquic/sample```, run 
```
../picoquic_sample server 4433 ./ca-cert.pem ./server-key.pem ./server_files
``` 

and also (in another terminal)

```
../picoquic_sample client localhost 4433 ./temp <filename>
```

- This will produce two files ```client_timestamps.csv``` and ```server_timestamps.csv``` in 
```picoquic/sample```. Each should have ```n_iterations``` number of entries. The server timestamps 
are recorded every time the message is begun to be sent anew (i.e per iteration). The client timestamp
is recorded everytime ```transfer_filesize``` number of bytes are received

- Make sure to restart the server between successive runs of the experiment. The use of global 
variables messes up the experiment if the server is not restarted between successive trials.

- From ```picoquic/sample``` run 

```
python3 latency_measurement.py
```

which should print out the mean latency for each message.

- Repeat with different file sizes.
